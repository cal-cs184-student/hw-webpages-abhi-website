		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			For this project, I want to preface my writeup by saying that at one point, I had my global illumination working. However, during some process of my code, I believe I accidentally changed something that caused it to not work, and it was a bug that I was unable to figure out. There were images that I took with global illumination which I have included, but it is apparent when it stopped working by looking at the images.
		</p>
		<p>
			This homework was the most difficult for me as I struggled with understanding the geometry/linear algebra that went with ray tracing. I believe this project allowed me to better understand these topics, even though I wasnâ€™t able to fully implement them. The approach that I took to solve these problems included watching the lectures, going through discussion again, and looking up YouTube videos to better understand some of the physics concepts behind light as well.

		<p>
			Some of the problems that I encountered, aside from the ones already mentioned, include my sphere logic

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		
		Ray generation and primitive intersection: Ray generation was difficult to me at first as it took me a considerable amount of time to conceptualize between the world to camera and camera to world spaces. However, the method by which we created our rays starts from finding the ray in our camera space, done through using our sensor coordinates and finding an according direction array. We then need to transform our ray into the world space given existing variables initialized for us in order to properly render the image in our world view. We also then used Monte Carlo integration to obtain averaged pixel values based on the radiance we received from different rays intersecting a pixel, which is important because this is more so closer to how it is perceived in reality.

		For the sphere intersection, our approach was more programmatic in the sense that we continuously used the discriminant in order to first determine how many intersection points we have (if there were any), and then use these values in conjunction with the normal vector from the center to obtain proper interpolation throughout our sphere.


		Triangle intersection: In regards to primitive intersection, we were able to take advantage of algorithms such as the Moller Trumbore algorithm, where we took advantage of having access to points and normals in order to find a t point that helps define the time that our ray takes to intersect the triangle. Furthermore, our other resulting values from this were used in conjunction with the normals in order to properly interpolate within our triangle. Throughout this algorithm, we used the cross products and the edge vectors, where the cross products were helpful in determining the barycentric coordinates, and the edge vectors for identifying possible points of intersection.



		<p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an organized fashion.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
